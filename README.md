**Formal Verification:**
To formally verify the Trade Position System, you could use a proof assistant like Coq or Isabelle. Here's a high-level outline of how you might prove some properties about the system:
Theorem 1: Opening a new position always returns a unique identifier.
Proof: By induction on the number of positions opened, showing that the position_id_counter always increments.
Theorem 2: Closing a position always removes it from the system.
Proof: By case analysis on whether the position exists or not, showing that the close_position function correctly removes the position or raises an error.
Theorem 3: The system never allows closing a non-existent position.
Proof: By showing that the close_position function always checks for existence before attempting to remove the position.
These proofs would involve formalizing the Trade Position System in the proof assistant's logic, and then writing tactics to prove the desired properties.
Keep in mind that formal verification is a complex task that requires significant expertise and effort. The example above is highly simplified and in practice, you would need to consider many more cases and properties to ensure the system's correctness.
This example provides a basic structure for TDD and formal verification. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity of your Trade Position System, you may need to adapt and extend this approach.
