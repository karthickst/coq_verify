**Formal Verification:**
To formally verify the Trade Position System, you could use a proof assistant like Coq or Isabelle. Here's a high-level outline of how you might prove some properties about the system:
Theorem 1: Opening a new position always returns a unique identifier.
Proof: By induction on the number of positions opened, showing that the position_id_counter always increments.
Theorem 2: Closing a position always removes it from the system.
Proof: By case analysis on whether the position exists or not, showing that the close_position function correctly removes the position or raises an error.
Theorem 3: The system never allows closing a non-existent position.
Proof: By showing that the close_position function always checks for existence before attempting to remove the position.
These proofs would involve formalizing the Trade Position System in the proof assistant's logic, and then writing tactics to prove the desired properties.
Keep in mind that formal verification is a complex task that requires significant expertise and effort. The example above is highly simplified and in practice, you would need to consider many more cases and properties to ensure the system's correctness.
This example provides a basic structure for TDD and formal verification. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity of your Trade Position System, you may need to adapt and extend this approach.



Coq code, we define the TradePosition and TradePositionSystem types, as well as the open_position, close_position, and get_positions functions. We then prove the three theorems about the system.
Theorem 1: open_position_unique_id shows that opening a new position always returns a unique identifier.
Theorem 2: close_position_removes shows that closing a position always removes it from the system.
Theorem 3: close_position_non_existent shows that the system never allows closing a non-existent position.
These theorems provide formal guarantees about the behavior of the Trade Position System, ensuring that it meets the desired properties.
Note that this is a simplified example, and in practice, you would need to consider many more cases and properties to ensure the system's correctness. Additionally, the Coq code may require modifications to fit the specific requirements of your system.



To validate the Coq formalization against the original implementation, you can use several approaches:
**Code Extraction:** Coq provides a mechanism for extracting Coq code into functional programming languages like Haskell, OCaml, or Scheme. You can extract the Coq code and compare it with the original implementation.
**Equivalence Checking:** You can write properties in Coq that relate the Coq formalization to the original implementation. For example, you can prove that the Coq formalization and the original implementation produce the same results for a given input.
**Testing:** You can generate test cases and run them on both the Coq formalization (using Coq's extraction mechanism or a Coq interpreter) and the original implementation. If the results match for a sufficient number of test cases, it increases confidence in the equivalence of the two implementations.
**Manual Review:** A manual review of both the Coq formalization and the original implementation can help identify any discrepancies or differences in behavior.
Let's demonstrate the equivalence checking approach. We'll write properties in Coq that relate the Coq formalization to the original Python implementation.

In this Coq code, we define the python_open_position and python_close_position functions to mimic the behavior of the original Python implementation. We then prove two theorems, open_position_equivalence and close_position_equivalence, which show that the Coq formalization and the Python implementation produce the same results for the open_position and close_position functions, respectively.
These theorems provide strong evidence that the Coq formalization accurately models the behavior of the original Python implementation.
